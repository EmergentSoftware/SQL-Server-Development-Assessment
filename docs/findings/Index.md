# Best Practices & Potential Findings

The sections below are where you will find the details for each of the checks performed in [sp_Develop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmergentSoftware/SQL-Server-Development-Assessment/master/sp_Develop.sql). 

Feel free to browse the finding groupings. There are best practices that do not have a check created yet.

some best practices might not have potential findings that sp_Develop can detect and some might have more than one

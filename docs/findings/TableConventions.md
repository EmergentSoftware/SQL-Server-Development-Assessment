## Incorrect Inheritance Type
**Check Id:** 147 [Not implemented yet. Click here to add the issue if you want to develop and create a pull request.](https://github.com/EmergentSoftware/SQL-Server-Development-Assessment/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Incorrect+Inheritance+Type)

Use the [Table Per Type (TPT)](https://entityframework.net/tpt) table design pattern.

The [Table Per Concrete (TPC)](https://entityframework.net/tpc) design is not good as it would have redundant data and no relationship between the sub tables. The redundant data would just be in multiple tables vs squished into one table with [Table Per Hierarchy (TPH)](https://entityframework.net/tph). TPC would help with the extra nullable columns compared to TPH.

TPC & TPH do not follow normal form.

## Using Entity Attribute Value
**Check Id:** 148 [Not implemented yet. Click here to add the issue if you want to develop and create a pull request.](https://github.com/EmergentSoftware/SQL-Server-Development-Assessment/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Using+Entity+Attribute+Value)

The [Entity–Attribute–Value (EAV) model ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model) falls victim to the [Inner-platform effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect).

The inner-platform effect is the tendency of software architects to create a system so customizable as to become a replica, and often a poor replica, of the software development platform they are using. This is generally inefficient and such systems are often considered to be examples of an [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern).

In the database world, developers are sometimes tempted to bypass the SQL Server relations database, for example by storing everything in one big table with three columns labelled EntityId, Key, and Value. While this entity-attribute-value model allows the developer to break out from the structure imposed by a SQL Server database, it loses out on all the benefits, since all of the work that could be done efficiently by the SQL Server relational database is forced onto the application instead. Queries become much more convoluted, the indexes and query optimizer can no longer work effectively, and data validity constraints are not enforced. Performance and maintainability can be extremely poor.

**Use Case Exceptions**

Data that meets the following criteria might be okay to use the EAV pattern at the discretion of the software or database architect.
- The definition of the data is highly dynamic and is likely to change numerous times of the course of the development and/or life of the application.
- The data has no intrinsic value outside the context of the application itself.
- The data will not be materialized in models but simply passed through the application layers as key value pairs.

Examples of valid use cases that meet this criteria are:
- Application user preferences
- User interface styling & custom layouts
- Saved user interface state
- Front-end application configuration

Another use case exception for utilizing an EAV model in a database is where the attributes are user defined and a developer will not have control over them.

Another use case exception for utilizing an EAV model is for something like a multiple product (entity) type shopping cart. Where each specific product (entity) type has its own list of attributes. If the product (entity) catalog only sells a manageable number of product different types the attributes, the attributes should be materialized as physical columns in the table schema. This type of EAV model will have diminishing returns for performance with more data housed in the database. Caching this type of EAV model will allow for a larger data set as to lessen the chance of performance issues. Ensure this is communicated to the stakeholders.

**Basic table model for a product catalog that supports multiple product types**

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.Attribute (
    AttributeId   int           IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL
   ,AttributeName nvarchar(100) NOT NULL
   ,CONSTRAINT Attribute_AttributeId PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (AttributeId ASC)
);

/* Insert values like "Size", "Color" */


CREATE TABLE dbo.AttributeTerm (
    AttributeTermId int           IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL
   ,AttributeId     int           NOT NULL CONSTRAINT AttributeTerm_Attribute FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES dbo.Attribute (AttributeId)
   ,TermName        nvarchar(100) NOT NULL
   ,CONSTRAINT AttributeTerm_AttributeTermId PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (AttributeTermId ASC)
);

/* Insert values like "Small", "Large", "Red", "Green" */


CREATE TABLE dbo.Product (
    ProductId          int           IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL
   ,ProductName        nvarchar(200) NOT NULL
   ,ProductSlug        nvarchar(400) NOT NULL
   ,ProductDescription nvarchar(MAX) NULL
   ,CONSTRAINT Product_ProductId PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (ProductId ASC)
   ,CONSTRAINT Product_ProductName UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED (ProductName ASC)
   ,CONSTRAINT Product_ProductSlug UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED (ProductSlug ASC)
);

/* Insert values like "Shirt", "Pants" */


CREATE TABLE dbo.ProductItem (
    ProductItemId int            IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL
   ,ProductId     int            NOT NULL CONSTRAINT ProductItem_Product FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES dbo.Product (ProductId)
   ,UPC           varchar(12)    NULL
   ,RegularPrice  decimal(18, 2) NOT NULL
   ,SalePrice     decimal(18, 2) NULL
   ,CONSTRAINT ProductItem_ProductItemId PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (ProductItemId ASC)
);

/* Insert values product UPC codes and prices */


CREATE TABLE dbo.ProductVariant (
    ProductVariantId int IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL
   ,ProductItemId    int NOT NULL CONSTRAINT ProductVariant_ProductItem FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES dbo.ProductItem (ProductItemId)
   ,AttributeTermId  int NOT NULL CONSTRAINT ProductVariant_AttributeTerm FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES dbo.AttributeTerm (AttributeTermId)

## Incorrect Weak or Strong Table
**Check Id:** 149 [Not implemented yet. Click here to add the issue if you want to develop and create a pull request.](https://github.com/EmergentSoftware/SQL-Server-Development-Assessment/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Incorrect+Weak+or+Strong+Table)

Use the proper weak or strong table type based on the entity.

A weak table is one that can only exist when owned by another table. For example: a 'Room' can only exist in a 'Building'.

An 'Address' is a strong table because it exists with or without a person or organization.

With an 'Address' table you would have a linking, or many-to-many table.

|ResidenceId|AddressTypeId|PersonId|AddressId|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|1|456|233|
|2|1|234|167|
|3|2|622|893|


A 'Phone Number' is a weak table because it generally does not exist without a person or organization.

With a 'Phone Number' table you would not use a linking table. The 'Phone Number' table would reference back to the person table.

|PersonId|FistName|LastName|
|--|--|--|
|1|Kevin|Martin|
|2|Han|Solo|
|3|Mace|Windu|

|PersonPhoneId|PhoneTypeId|PersonId|PhoneNumber|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|1|1|555-899-5543|
|2|1|2|(612) 233-2255|
|3|2|3|1+ (453) 556-9902|

A use case exception for using the proper weak or strong type is for security purposes. You might encounter a requirement for security that utilizing a linking table makes it impossible to have a discriminator to prevent read or modifications to a row.

## Nullable Columns with No Non-Null Records
**Check Id:** 150 [Not implemented yet. Click here to add the issue if you want to develop and create a pull request.](https://github.com/EmergentSoftware/SQL-Server-Development-Assessment/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Nullable+Columns+with+No+Non-Null+Records)

If the row data in the table does not contain any ```NULL``` values you should assess setting the column to not 'Allow Nulls'.

Null-ness does more than constraining the data, it factors in on performace optimizer decisions.

For data warehouses do not allow ```NULL``` values for dimensional tables. You can create a -1 identifier with the value of [UNKNOWN]. This helps business analysts who might not understand the difference between INNER and OUTER JOINs exclude data in their TSQL queries.

### Nullable Columns and JOIN Elimination

If a column has a foreign key and nullable, it will not be trusted and ```JOIN``` Elimination will not occur, forcing your query to perform more query operations than needed.

This execution plan shows how ```JOIN``` elimination works. There is a foreign key on the column and the column does not allow null. There is only one index operation in the execution plan. SQL Server is able to eliminate JOINs because it "trusts" the data relationship.

- See [Untrusted Foreign Key](#untrusted-foreign-key)

![Non-SARGable Scan vs. SARGable Seek](../Images/JOIN_Elimination_NOT_NULL.png)

This execution plan shows ```JOIN``` elimination has not occurred. While there is a foreign key on the column, the column allows null. There are two index operations and a merge operation causing SQL Server to perform more work.

## Using Cascading Actions on Foreign Key
**Check Id:** 151 [Not implemented yet. Click here to add the issue if you want to develop and create a pull request.](https://github.com/EmergentSoftware/SQL-Server-Development-Assessment/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Using+Cascading+Actions+on+Foreign+Key)

Use a stored procedure or SQL command in your software code to delete data in multiple related tables instead of `ON DELETE CASCADE` on the foreign key.

Foreign keys with cascading actions like `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON UPDATE ?` perform slowly due to SQL Server taking out serializable locks (RANGEX-X) to guarantee referential integrity so that it can trust the foreign keys.

You may also receive the error message below when you utilize `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

```
Msg 1785, Level 16, State 0, Line 190
Introducing FOREIGN KEY constraint [ForeignKeyName] on table [TableName] may cause cycles or multiple cascade paths.
Specify ON DELETE NO ACTION or ON UPDATE NO ACTION, or modify other FOREIGN KEY constraints.
Msg 1750, Level 16, State 1, Line 190
Could not create constraint or index. See previous errors.

<a name="29"/><a name="using-unique-constraint-instead-of-unique-indexes"/>

## Unique Constraint or Unique Indexes Usage
**Check Id:** 29

Create unique indexes instead of unique constraints (unique key). Doing so removes a dependency of a unique key to the unique index that is created automatically and tightly coupled.

**Instead of:** ```CONSTRAINT AddressType_AddressTypeName_Unique UNIQUE (AddressTypeName ASC)```

**Use:** ```INDEX AddressType_AddressTypeName UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED (AddressTypeName ASC)```

In some table design cases you might need to create uniqueness for one or more columns. This could be for a natural [composite] key or to ensure a person can only have one phone number and phone type combination.

There is no functional or performance difference between a unique constraint (unique key) and a unique index. With both you get a unique index, but with a unique constraint (unique key) the 'Ignore Duplicate Keys' and 'Re-compute statistics' index creation options are not available.

The only possible benefit of a unique constraint (unique key) has over a unique index is to emphasize the purpose of the index and is displayed in the SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) table 'Keys' folder in the 'Object Explorer' side pane.

## More Than 5 Indexes
**Check Id:** 32

Your table might be over indexed. The more you have the less performant insert, update & deletes are. A general rule of thumb is 5 indexes on a table.

A general rule is to aim for 5 indexes per table, with around 5 columns or less on each index. This is not a set-in-stone rule, but if you go beyond the general rule you should ensure you are only creating indexes that are required for the SQL Server query workload. If you have a read-only database, there will be no inserts, updates, or deletes to maintain on all those indexes.

You or your DBA should implement an index tuning strategy like below.

1. **Dedupe** - reduce overlapping indexes
2. **Eliminate** - unused indexes
3. **Add** - badly needed missing indexes
4. **Tune** - indexes for specific queries
5. **Heap** - usually need clustered indexes

## Filter Columns Not In Index Definition
**Check Id:** 154 [Not implemented yet.

Add the filtered columns in the ```INCLUDE()``` on your index so your queries do not need to perform a key lookup. By including the filtered columns, SQL Server generates statistics on the columns.

**Instead Of:**

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX Account_Greater_Than_Half_Million
    ON dbo.Account (AccountName, AccountId)
    WHERE Balance > 500000;
```

**Do This:**

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX Account_Greater_Than_Half_Million
    ON dbo.Account (AccountName, AccountId)
    INCLUDE (Balance)
    WHERE Balance > 500000;

## Low Index Fill-Factor
**Check Id:** 37

The default fill factor is (100 or 0) for SQL Server. This check is alerting you to a fill factor of 80% or lower.

Best practice is to ONLY use a low fill factor on indexes where you know you need it. Setting a low fill factor on too many indexes will hurt your performance:

- Wasted space in storage
- Wasted space in memory (and therefore greater memory churn)
- More IO, and with it higher CPU usage

Review indexes diagnosed with low fill factor. Check how much they’re written to. Look at the keys and determine whether insert and update patterns are likely to cause page splits.

## Untrusted Foreign Key or Check Constraints
**Check Id:** 38

SQL Server is not going to consider using untrusted constraints to compile a better execution plan. This can have a huge performance impact on your database queries.

You might have disabled a constraint instead of dropping and recreating it for bulk loading data. This is fine, as long as your remember to enable it correctly.

[If you don't specify, WITH CHECK is assumed for new constraints, and WITH NOCHECK is assumed for re-enabled constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=sql-server-ver16#with-check--with-nocheck).

```sql
ALTER TABLE dbo.TableName WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ConstraintName;
GO
```

The `CHECK CHECK` syntax is correct. The 1st `CHECK` is the end of `WITH CHECK` statement. The 2nd `CHECK` is the start of the `CHECK CONSTRAINT` clause to enable the constraint

To find untrusted foreign keys and check constraints in your database run the script below to identify and create an ``ALTER`` statement to correct the issue. In Redgate SQL Prompt the snippet code is ``fk``. If you receive an error with the generated ``ALTER`` statement it means past constraint violations have been being suppressed by ``WITH NOCHECK``. You will have to figure out how to fix the rows that do not comply with the constraint.

```
SELECT
    SchemaName = S.name
   ,TableName  = T.name
   ,ObjectName = FK.name
   ,ObjectType = 'FOREIGN KEY'
   ,FixSQL     = 'ALTER TABLE ' + QUOTENAME(S.name) + '.' + QUOTENAME(T.name) + ' WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ' + FK.name + ';'
FROM
    sys.foreign_keys       AS FK
    INNER JOIN sys.tables  AS T
        ON FK.parent_object_id = T.object_id
    INNER JOIN sys.schemas AS S
        ON T.schema_id         = S.schema_id
WHERE
    FK.is_not_trusted         = 1
AND FK.is_not_for_replication = 0

UNION ALL

SELECT
    SchemaName = S.name
   ,TableName  = T.name
   ,ObjectName = CC.name

   ,FixSQL     = 'ALTER TABLE ' + QUOTENAME(S.name) + '.' + QUOTENAME(T.name) + ' WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ' + CC.name + ';'

WHERE
    CC.is_not_trusted         = 1
AND CC.is_not_for_replication = 0

## uniqueidentifier in a Clustered Index
**Check Id:** 22

``uniqueidentifier/guid`` columns should not be in a clustered index. Even NEWSEQUENTIALID() should not be used in a clustered index. The sequential ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` is based on the SQL Server's MAC address. When an Availability Group fails over the next ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` will not be sequential anymore.

SQL Server will bad page split and fragment an index when a new record is inserted instead of being inserting on the last page using standard best practices for index maintenance. The clustered index will become fragmented because of randomness of ``uniqueidentifier/guid``. Index maintenance set to the default fill factor of 0 (packed 100%) will force bad page splits.

A use case for when you can use ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` as a primary key & clustered index, is when there are separate systems and merging rows would be difficult. The uniqueness of ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` simplifies the data movements.

DBAs have historically not implemented ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` as primary keys and/or clustered indexes. The traditional index maintenance jobs would keep the ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` indexes in a perpetual state of fragmentation causing bad page splits, which is an expensive process.

A new index maintenance strategy is to name these ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` indexes with the ending "*_INDEX_REBUILD_ONLY" and create a customized index maintenance plan. One job step will perform the standard index maintenance ignoring the ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` indexes and another job step will only perform an index rebuild, skipping index reorganizations. [Ola Hallengren maintenance scripts](https://ola.hallengren.com/) is recommended.

These ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` indexes should be created and rebuilt with a custom fill factor to account for at least a weeks' worth of data. This is not a "set it, and forget it" maintenance plan and will need some looking after.

These are a 400 level tasks and please feel free to reach out to a DBA for assistance.

## Missing Index for Foreign Key
**Check Id:** 21

Each foreign key in your table should be included in an index. Start off with an index on just the foreign key column if you have no workload to tune a multi-column index. There is a real good chance the indexes will be used when queries join on the parent table.

## uniqueidentifier For Primary Key
**Check Id:** 8

Using ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` as primary keys causes issues with SQL Server databases. ``uniqueidentifier/guid`` are unnecessarily wide (4x wider than an INT).

``uniqueidentifiers/guids`` are not user friendly when working with data. PersonId = 2684 is more user friendly then PersonId = 0B7964BB-81C8-EB11-83EC-A182CB70C3ED.

## Heap
**Check Id:** 6

Add a clustered index.

SQL Server storage is built around the clustered index as a fundamental part of the data storage and retrieval engine. The data itself is stored with the clustered key. All this makes having an appropriate clustered index a vital part of database design. The places where a table without a clustered index is preferable are rare; which is why a missing clustered index is a common code smell in database design.

A 'table' without a clustered index is a heap, which is a particularly bad idea when its data is usually returned in an aggregated form, or in a sorted order. Paradoxically, though, it can be rather good for implementing a log or a ‘staging’ table used for bulk inserts, since it is read very infrequently, and there is less overhead in writing to it. 

A table with a non-clustered index, but without a clustered index can sometimes perform well even though the index must reference individual rows via a Row Identifier rather than a more meaningful clustered index. The arrangement can be effective for a table that isn’t often updated if the table is always accessed by a non-clustered index and there is no good candidate for a clustered index.

Heaps have performance issues like table scans, forward fetches.

## Not Normalizing Tables
**Check Id:** 155 [Not implemented yet. Click here to add the issue if you want to develop and create a pull request.](https://github.com/EmergentSoftware/SQL-Server-Development-Assessment/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Not+Normalizing+Tables)

[Database Normalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) tables is regarded as a best practice methodology for relational databases design. Relational database tables should be normalized to at least the [Boyce–Codd normal form (BCNF or 3.5NF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form).

These normalizing principles are used to reduce data duplication, avoid data anomalies, ensure table relationship integrity, and make data management simplified.

You should always normalize the database schema unless you have a really good reason not to. Denormalizing has been performed in the past with the saying "Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until it works". Denormalization almost always leads to eventual issues. Denormalization complicates updates, deletes & inserts making the database difficult to modify. We have tools like indexed or materialized views and covering indexes to remediate performance issues. There are query rewriting techniques that can make queries more performant. 

A normalize table design like addresses and phone numbers in separate tables allows for extensibility when the requirements today might only call for a single phone number or address. You can utilize a ``UNIQUE`` constraint/index to ensure only a single row can exist but allows for flexibility in the future. You will already have the Phone table so you will not have to create a new table and migrate the data and drop the ``UNIQUE`` constraint/index.
